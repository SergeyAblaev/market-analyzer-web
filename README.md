It's an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), with Streaming / Reactive pipeline.

## Setup instructions:

Todo - Create instructions!

## Data Flow:

Binance WS  
↓  
TradeEvent  
↓  
OHLC Aggregator  
↓  
Closed Candle (here is calling RuleEngine)  
↓  
RuleEngine   (stateful rules with candle history)
↓  
MacOS Alert  

## Rules:

PriceThresholdRule
PercentChangeRule - Checks that the price has changed by Y% in X minutes
ImpulseMoveRule - Calculate ALERT: STRONG BULLISH IMPULSE / BEARISH IMPULSE

# Todo:
- For add/remove tickers: Do replace code from 'Restarting ALL WS' -> 'Restarting ONE shard'!
- Think about zero-downtime resubscribe (with no restart)
- add latency monitoring

## Kafka buffering (future)

### Problem
Direct WS → processing:
- burst traffic
- data loss risk
- tight coupling

### Possible Solution

Binance WS → Kafka → Consumers

### Flow

[Binance WS]

[WebSocketClient]

[Kafka Producer]

### Benefits

- backpressure handling
- replay capability
- horizontal scaling
- fault tolerance
